### Overview

Bocks shows a heat map of publicly traded stocks on global exchanges. Gauge public sentiment using Twitter and AI, research company details and gather insights from current news articles. The heatmap gathers it’s data from a live api. Map tiles will transition from shades of deep red (stock losses) to yellow (flat price action), to green (gains). Clicking a tile, or entering a search term will navigate you to the company details page where you can view more info on the company’s mission, executive team, current tweets about the company and current news articles. Right now only live price action is supported but more chart data and chart types will be added later. The app works on iOS devices and all data is aggregated from free/open source api’s.

This is a work in progress that will be updated periodically as more open-source data becomes available. You will need to add your own API Keys in a plist file to run the project. This has not been fully updated in over a year but you can follow it’s progress with the todo list below. Happy trading!
